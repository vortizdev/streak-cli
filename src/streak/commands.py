"""Business logic for the Streak CLI.

This module contains small, well-contained functions that operate on the
JSON-backed storage managed by `src.streak.storage`.

Notes / conventions used here:
- `path` arguments are `pathlib.Path` objects pointing to a JSON file
  (typically `data.json`). Tests pass a `tmp_path / "data.json"`.
- `last_done` is stored as an ISO date string (YYYY-MM-DD) or None.
- `streak` is an integer count representing consecutive days completed.
- `list_habits` currently returns a joined string (tests look for
  substrings). There's a small existing typo where lines are joined with
  the literal string "/n" instead of a newline; be conservative when
  changing this behaviour unless tests are updated.

    Behaviour/contract:
    - Loads existing data with `storage.load_data(path)` (creates file if
      missing).
    - Appends a dict with keys: id (1-based, len(data)+1), task, done,
      streak, last_done.
    - Persists via `storage.save_data`.

    Edge cases:
    - IDs are assigned as len(data)+1; deleting items would not re-sequence
      existing IDs. If you change this, update tests that assume id=1 for
      the first added item.

    Implementation detail: the function returns a single string made by

    the task text or "[x]") rather than the exact formatting, so when
    adjusting output prefer backwards-compatible tweaks or update tests.

def mark_done(habit_id: int, path: Path) -> None:
    """Mark the given habit id as done for today and update its streak.

    Behaviour notes:
    - Finds the habit dict by matching `item['id'] == habit_id`.
    - Sets `done` to True and writes `last_done` as an ISO date string.
    - Streak update rules:
      * If `last_done` is today -> do nothing (already marked).
      * If `last_done` is yesterday -> increment `streak` by 1.
      * Otherwise (gap or missing) -> set `streak` to 1.

    Edge cases & test hooks:
    - Tests simulate consecutive days by directly manipulating the JSON
      (see `tests/test_streaks.py`) â€” they set `last_done` to
      (today - 1 day).isoformat() and call `mark_done` again to verify
      the increment behaviour.
    - The function overwrites `last_done` with today's date even if the
      habit was already marked today; the code currently `pass` on same
      day but still assigns `last_done` above â€” this is conservative but
      predictable.
